========== ARENA HELP ==========

Arenas are saved and loaded from plugin_data so no need to manually save anything.

Creating new arena's:

 - /koth new <arena name> <min players> <max players> <game time>
   No spaces in name ^        ^ Numbers above 1 ^         ^ amount of seconds game runs for. (above 5)

 - /koth setpos1 <arena name>
   Stand on one corner of the king's area. (during this the world is auto-detected.)

 - /koth setpos2 <arena name>
   Stand on the opposite corner of the king's area (Height is important if there's nothing above it's advised to go a few blocks up to allow for jumping)

 - /koth setspawn <area name>
   Can be used any amount of times. (stand in the spawn location you wish to add)

 - /koth addreward <arena name> <command reward eg. 'say {PLAYER} Won the game !'>
   Can be used any amount of times. (No way to remove rewards yet)

 If all went well, the arena status should become 'ready' (can be seen in /koth list or /koth info <arena name>)
 and you can then join the arena.

Removing an Arena:
 - /koth rem <arena name>

 You can only remove it if the arena is not in use.

Joining an Arena:
 - /koth join <arena name>

 You can only join an arena if its status is Ready or Started
 Status can be seen in /koth list (or /koth info <arena name>)

Leaving an Game:
 - /koth leave

 The command will only work if your in an Arena, Alternatively leaving the server/mcpe will also make you leave the mini-game.

Arena Info/Status:
 - /koth list
   Displays a list of all arena's created and their status.

 - /koth info <arena name>
   Displays more information on one arena.
   (Players in game, Game time, Amount of spawns etc.)
